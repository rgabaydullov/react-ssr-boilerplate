# react-ssr-boilerplate
The fast and flexible solution for SSR on React (Redux, Thunk, Sass, YML) applications

## Usability
It's easy-to-use as a starter maintenance:
* React + Redux
* Dynamically imported components (Loadable)
* Hot Reloading (really fast)
* Advanced loaders: Sass, Yaml, File
* Express Web-server

## Installation
1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

Look into output inside `/dist` folder.

## Recap
The boilerplate uses `servre/run.js` as entry point for building.
Webpack (Client -> Server) output runs the prepared `server.js` bundle on Express.
